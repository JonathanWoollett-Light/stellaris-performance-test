### Key
- **Value:** Some generic value for a resource, may be market value (a bunch of them are just values I thought reasonable, could be player decided).
- **Inter-planetary:** Is this resource summed  across planets? (food is, housing is not).
- **Additive:** Does this resoure add up each month? (food does, housing does not).

### Synonyms

- **Crime = Deviancy:**  Don't really get why they didn't just call it 'order' and not have this awkward difference.
